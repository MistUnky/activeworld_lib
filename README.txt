activeworld_lib

adds functions for plant/plont growth/death cycles (plont == nonair plants), parasite nodes, finite liquids, synced blocks, land erosion, and abm falling nodes

by default it will load up example functions which make minetest_game world active (see init.lua for what the example showcase does in detail)
